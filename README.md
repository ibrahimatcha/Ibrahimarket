# Ibrahimarket App

Was a fun exercise, got a bit carried away in some aspects rather than strictly sticking to the scope of the brief 
but tried to not overengineer a solution. 

Some of my structure is a bit messy as I was unfamiliar with creating an app with a CLI, 
and I am used to the standard Controller -> Service -> DAO kind of setup.

I have some 'inconsistencies' in design such as using recursive method calling compared to using a while loop to ensure
a criteria was met but wanted to show both patterns in action.

Overall I quite enjoyed the exercise!
